## Two types of process in the field of NLP:

	1. Predication based 
	2. Text Analysis 

NLP Based Application:
Prediction + CTA = NLP Application 

How computer understands a text?
Convert text into Numbers(Vectors) via Counter Vector or Hash or TF-IDF Vector 
	• Counter Vector - will take unique words as columns and count word occurrences for every row; now text is converted into numbers

NLP Model Creation 
Text -> Numbers(Vectors) -> Training (to create model) and Test Set (to evaluate model) -> Model Creation 

General:
	• NLP can be used for supervised and unsupervised learning. NLP can use ML algorithms, DL algorithms and NLP-specific algorithms. 

	• For NLP especially, validated data is important prior to model creation

 ## FAKENEWS Folder 
 This has a detailed readme.md file and Jupyter notebooks that outlines various types of vectors - TF-IDF Vector, Counter Vector and Hashing Vector

  ## SENTIMENT Folder 
 This has a readme.md file and Jupyter notebooks that outlines various types of text analysis such as sentiment analysis, word cloud, topic modelling, etc.
